Extraction Preset is a gate action provided on any gate placed that is placed on a Emzuli Transport Pipe.

When the Extraction Preset gate action is selected and the connected triggers are activated, the gate will allow the colour of the Extraction Preset to be extracted by the Emzuli Pipe.
Without an extraction preset set by the gate, the Emzuli Pipe will be unable to extract any items.
