Loop is a gate action provided on any gate that is placed next to a machine which could be operating.

When the action is activated, the machine will repeatedly complete its operating cycle over and over again.

Gates may show the Loop action multiple times in different colours to represent each of the different connected machines.
The colour of the action represents the direction of the machine in relation of the pipe so you can differentiate between each machine.

Note: Not all machines support the Loop action.
