On is a gate action provided on any gate placed that is placed next to a machine which could be operating.

When the On gate action is selected and the connected triggers are activated, the machine will start operating.

Gates may show the On action multiple times in different colours to represent each of the different connected machines.
The colour of the action represents the direction of the machine in relation of the pipe so you can differentiate between each machine.

Note: Not all machines support the On action.
