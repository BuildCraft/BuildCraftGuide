Redstone Signal is a gate action provided on any gate placed.

When the Redstone Signal gate action is selected and the connected triggers are activated, it will emit a Redstone signal.

When Redstone Signal and the gate installed has parameters available, the Gate Side Only becomes availible as a parameter.
Selecting Gate side only means it will only emit a Redstone signal out the specific side the gate is placed on.
