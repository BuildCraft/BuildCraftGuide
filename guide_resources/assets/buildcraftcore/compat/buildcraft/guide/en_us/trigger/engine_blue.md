Engine Blue is a gate trigger provided on any gate placed that has an Engine next to it.

Whenever the Engine Blue gate tigger is selected, the selected connected action will only be activated when the adjacent engine is at its blue tempurature stage.

Gates may show the Engine Blue trigger multiple times in different colours to represent each of the different connected engines.
The colour of the Trigger represents the direction of the engine in relation of the pipe so you can differentiate between each engine.
