Fluid in Tank is a gate trigger provided on any gate that has a tank placed next to it.

When selected, the connected actions will only be activated when the connected tank has fluids in.

When Fluid in Tank and the gate installed has parameters available, the Filter slots next to it becomes available as a parameter.
Placing a Fluid container in the filter slots allows you check if the tank has the fluid selected in filter slot before triggering.

Gates may show the Fluid in Tank trigger multiple times in different colours to represent each of the different connected tanks.
The colour of the Trigger represents the direction of the tank in relation of the pipe so you can differentiate between each tank.
