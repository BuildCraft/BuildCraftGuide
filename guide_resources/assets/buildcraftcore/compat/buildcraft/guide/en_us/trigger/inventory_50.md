Contains <50% is a gate trigger provided on any gate placed that has an inventory placed next to it.

Whenever the Contains <50% gate tigger is selected, the selected connected action will only be activated when the connected inventory is at less than 50% capacity.

When Contains <50% and the gate installed has parameters available, the Filter slots next to it becomes availible as a parameter.
Placing Items in the filter slots allows you check if the inventory has less than 50% of the items selected in filters slots before the resulting action is activated.

Gates may show the Contains <50% trigger multiple times in different colours to represent each of the different connected inventories.
The colour of the Trigger represents the direction on the inventory in relation of the pipe so you can differentiate between each inventory.
