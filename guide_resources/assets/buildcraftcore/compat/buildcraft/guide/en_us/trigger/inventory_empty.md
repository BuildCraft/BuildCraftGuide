Inventory Empty is a gate trigger provided on any gate that has an inventory placed next to it.

When selected, the connected actions will only be activated when all of the connected Inventory slot has Zero items in.

Gates may show the Inventory Empty trigger multiple times in different colours to represent each of the different connected inventories.
The colour of the Trigger represents the direction on the inventory in relation of the pipe so you can differentiate between each inventory.
