Inventory Full is a gate trigger provided on any gate that has an inventory placed next to it.

When selected, the connected actions will only be activated when all of the connected inventory slot has an item in.

Gates may show the Inventory Full trigger multiple times in different colours to represent each of the different connected inventories.
The colour of the Trigger represents the direction on the inventory in relation of the pipe so you can differentiate between each inventory.
