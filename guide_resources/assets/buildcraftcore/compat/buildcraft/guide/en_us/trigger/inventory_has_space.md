Space in Inventory is a gate trigger provided on any gate placed that has inventory placed next to it.

Whenever the Space in Inventory gate tigger is selected, the selected connected action will only be activated when the connected inventory has slots empty to accept items in.

When Space in Inventory and the gate installed has parameters available, the Filter slots next to it becomes available as a parameter.
Placing Items in the filter slots allows you check if the inventory has any empty slots or incomplete slots that can accept the items selected in filters slots before the resulting action is activated.

Gates may show the Space in Inventory trigger multiple times in different colours to represent each of the different connected inventories.
The colour of the Trigger represents the direction of the inventory in relation of the pipe so you can differentiate between each inventory.
