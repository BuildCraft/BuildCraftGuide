Contains <25% is a gate trigger provided on any gate placed that has a tank placed next to it.

Whenever the Contains <25% gate tigger is selected, the selected connected action will only be activated when the connected tank is at less than 25% capacity.

When Contains <25% and the gate installed has parameters available, the Filter slot next to it becomes availible as a parameter.
Placing a fluid container in the filter slot allows you check if the tank has less than 25% of the fluid selected in the filter slot before the resulting action is activated.

Gates may show the Contains <25% trigger multiple times in different colours to represent each of the different connected tanks.
The colour of the Trigger represents the direction on the tank in relation of the pipe so you can differentiate between each tank.
