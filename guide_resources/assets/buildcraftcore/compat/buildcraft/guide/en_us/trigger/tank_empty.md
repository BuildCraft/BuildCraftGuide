Tank Empty is a gate trigger provided on any gate placed that has a tank placed next to it.

Whenever the Tank Empty gate tigger is selected, the selected connected action will only be activated when all of the connected tank has zero fluid in.

Gates may show the Tank Empty trigger multiple times in different colours to represent each of the different connected tanks.
The colour of the Trigger represents the direction on the tank in relation of the pipe so you can differentiate between each tank.
