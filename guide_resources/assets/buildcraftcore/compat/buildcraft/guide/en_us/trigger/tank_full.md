Tank Full is a gate trigger provided on any gate that has a tank placed next to it.

When selected, the connected actions will only be activated when the adjacent tank has no room to accept anymore fluids.

Gates may show the Tank Full trigger multiple times in different colours to represent each of the different connected tanks.
The colour of the Trigger represents the direction of the tank in relation of the pipe so you can differentiate between each tank.
