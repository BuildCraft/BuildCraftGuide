Space for Fluid is a gate trigger provided on any gate placed that has a tank placed next to it.

Whenever the Space for Fluid gate tigger is selected, the selected connected action will only be activated when the connected tank has space to recieve anymore fluid.

When Space for Fluid and the gate installed has parameters available, the Filter slot next to it becomes available as a parameter.
Placing a fluid container in the filter slot allows you check if there are anys that can accept the fluid selected in filter before the resulting action is activated.

Gates may show the Space for Fluid trigger multiple times in different colours to represent each of the different connected tanks.
The colour of the Trigger represents the direction of the tank in relation of the pipe so you can differentiate between each tank.
