Whenever the Pipe Signal On gate trigger is selected, the selected connected action will only be activated when the connected pipe wire of the same colour is activated.

When Pipe Signal On and the gate installed has parameters available, the Pipe Signal On and Pipe Signal Off of the other connected Pipe Wire Colours becomes available as a parameter.
Selecting Pipe Signal On or Pipe Signal Off to your inital trigger means you can have multiple pipe wire requirements before the resulting action is activated.
