Single Power Pulse is a gate action provided on any gate that also has a Pipe Pulsar is attatched to the same pipe.

When the action is activated, the Pipe Pulsar is activated for a short time and the pipe will recieve enough power to complete one operation.

Gates may show the Power Pulsar action multiple times in different colours to represent each of the different connected Pipe Pulsars.
The colour of the action represents the direction of the Pipe Pulsar in relation of the pipe so you can differentiate between each Pipe Pulsar.
