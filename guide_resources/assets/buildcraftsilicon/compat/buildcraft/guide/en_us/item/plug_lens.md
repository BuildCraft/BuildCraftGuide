The Lens is a pluggable used to paint any item that travel through it the same colour as the lens itself.

The painting of items allows you extra filtering options for your pipe system but does not actually affect their ingame colour.
Lenses can only be placed on item Transport pipes as only items can be painted.

Pluggables can only be placed on pipes and can be placed on any side of a pipe.
It will not stop any other pipe and pipe wire connection between two pipes when placed in between.
