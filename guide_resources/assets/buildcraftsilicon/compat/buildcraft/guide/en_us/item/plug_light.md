The Light Sensor is a pluggable used to detect the light level of the block infront of it and provide that data to the Gate on the adjacent side of the  same pipe.

This data allows the adjacent Gate to detect whether it is light or dark through the Bright and Dark triggers.
These Bright and Dark triggers can be used to trigger an action through a Gate.

Pluggables can only be placed on pipes and can be placed on any side of a pipe.
It will stop any other pipe and pipe wire connection between two pipes when placed in between.
