Extraction Preset is a gate action provided on any gate that is placed on a Emzuli Transport Pipe.

When the action is activated, the gate will allow the colour of the Extraction Preset selected to be extracted by the Emzuli Pipe.
Without an extraction preset set by the gate, the Emzuli Pipe will be unable to extract any items.
