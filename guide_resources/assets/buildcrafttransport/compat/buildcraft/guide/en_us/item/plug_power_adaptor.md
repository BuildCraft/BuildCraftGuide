The pipe pulsar is useful upgrade from powering wooden pipes with engines, but it seems... lacking. It would be useful if the existing power grid and engines could be used to power extraction pipes at a higher speed.

The Pipe Adpater is a pluggable used to power accepting pipes to be powered through a Kinesis Pipe.
It can only be placed on any power accepting pipe and any kinesis pipe placed next to it will connect.

Power fed through the connected Kinesis Pipe will be able to power the connected power accepting transport/fluid pipe.

Pluggables can only be placed on pipes and can be placed on any side of a pipe.
It will stop any other pipe and pipe wire connection between two pipes when placed in between other than Kinesis Pipes and itself.
