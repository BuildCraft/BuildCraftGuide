A Clay Transport Pipe is used to transport items from a pipe into either another adjacent pipe or inventory.

The Clay Transport pipe will priotitise trying to insert items into an adjacent inventory before traveling to the next pipe.

Incase of their being multiple directions items could go, the items will prioritise an adjacent inventory before going in a random direction.(It is recommended to use pipe plugs to stop the multiple connections).
Items will not travel back in the direction it came from and only in a different direction.
If there is no connecting pipe or the adjacent inventory is full and there is no where else for the item to go, the item will drop out of the pipe onto the ground.

Some machines can automatically output items directly into a Clay Transport Pipe without needing to be fed through an extraction pipe.
