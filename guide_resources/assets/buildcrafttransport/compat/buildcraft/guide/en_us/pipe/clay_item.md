A Clay Transport Pipe is used to transport items from a pipe into a connecting pipes/inventories.

The Clay Transport pipe will priotitise trying to insert items into an inventory before traveling onwards.

If it has multiple connecting sides, the items will prioritise a connected inventory before travelling in a random direction.
Items will not travel back in the direction it came from and only go a different direction.
If there is no where for the travelling items to go, they will be dropped out of the pipe onto the ground.

Some machines can automatically output items directly into it without being fed through a powered extraction pipe.
Using Pipe Plugs or painting pipes a different colour can stop pipes connecting.
