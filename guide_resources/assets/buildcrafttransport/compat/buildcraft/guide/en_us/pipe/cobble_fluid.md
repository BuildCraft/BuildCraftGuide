Cobblestone Fluid pipes are the slowest pipe at transport fluids.

Cobblestone Fluid pipes will not connect to Stone Fluid Pipes or Quartz Fluid Pipes.

Fluids will not travel back in the direction it came from and only in a different direction.
If there are multiple directions the fluids could go, the fluids will be distrubuted evenly between them.

Some machines can output fluids directly into it without being fed through a powered extraction pipe.
Using Pipe Plugs or painting pipes a different colour can stop pipes connecting.

The Cobblestone Fluid pipe transports fluids to adjacent pipes and tanks at 0.2 buckets per second.
Fluid pipes have an internal fluid tank which can hold 1 bucket per side and 1 Bucket in the centre.
