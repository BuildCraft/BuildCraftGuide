A Cobblestone Fluid Pipe is used to transport fluids from a pipe into either another adjacent pipe or tank.
Some machines can autoput fluids drectly into a Cobblestone Fluid Pipe without needing to be fed through an extraction pipe.

Fluids will not travel back in the direction it came from and only in a different direction.
Incase of their being multiple directions fluids could go, the fluids will be distrubuted evenly between them.
(It is recommended to use pipe plugs to stop the multiple connections)

Cobblestone Fluid pipes will not connect to Stone Fluid Pipes or Quartz Fluid Pipes.

The Cobblestone Fluid pipe transports fluids to adjacent pipes and tanks at 0.2 buckets per second.
Fluid pipes have an internal fluid tank which can hold 1 bucket per side and 1 Bucket in the centre.
