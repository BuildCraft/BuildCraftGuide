A Cobblestone Transport Pipe is used to transport items from a pipe into connecting pipes/inventories.

The Cobblestone Transport pipe gives transported items a high amount of drag so they will slow accelerated items quickly.

Cobblestone Transport pipes will not connect to Stone or Quartz Transport Pipes.

If it has multiple connecting sides, the items will travel in a random direction.
Items will not travel back in the direction it came from and only go a different direction.
If there is no where for the travelling items to go, they will be dropped out of the pipe onto the ground.

Some machines can automatically output items directly into it without being fed through a powered extraction pipe.
Using Pipe Plugs or painting pipes a different colour can stop pipes connecting.
