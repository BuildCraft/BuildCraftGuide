A Diamond Fluid Pipe is used to transport fluids from a pipe in a direction set by its filter into a connecting pipe/tank.

The Diamond Fluid pipe has each of its sides disguigished by a different colour.
Opening up the Diamond Fluid Pipe GUI will allow you to setup a filter.
Placng a bucket (or other fluid container) of the fluid you want in a certain slots colour will allow you to filter which fluid can go in which direction.
Having multiple of the same fluid in a colour will allow you to add 'weight' to where you fluids will go.

If it has multiple clear facing sides, fluids will be distrubuted (depending of the weight you give them) between them.
Any valid direction with no filter set will allow any fluid to pass through but filtered directions will take priority.
Fluids will not travel back in the direction it came from.

Using Pipe Plugs or painting pipes a different colour can stop pipes connecting.

Some machines can autoput fluids drectly into it without needing to be fed through a powered extraction pipe.

The Diamond Fluid pipe transports fluids to adjacent pipes and tanks at 1.6 buckets per second.
Fluid pipes have an internal fluid tank which can hold 1 bucket per side and 1 Bucket in the centre.
