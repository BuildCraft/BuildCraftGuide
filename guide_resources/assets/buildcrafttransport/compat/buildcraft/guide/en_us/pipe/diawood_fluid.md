A Wooden Diamond Fluid Pipe is used to extract selected fluids from a tank when given power.
It can recieve power from any MJ power source such as: an engine, a power adaptor, or a pipe pulsar.

When powered, It will extract the fluid selected by the filter into any other connected tanks/pipes.
Some machines can autoput fluids directly into a Wooden Diamond Fluid Pipe without needing power.

Opening up the Wooden Diamond Fluid Pipe GUI will allow you to setup a filter.
Placing a bucket (or other fluid container) of the fluid you want in the slots will allow you to filter what it extracts.
You can use the Whitelist and Blacklist items to change what your filter does:
Whitelist: Only the fluids selected will be extracted.
Blacklist: Any fluid other than the fluid selected will be extracted.

The extraction of fluids will occur out of solid side of the pipe towards the clear facing sides.
If it has multiple clear facing sides, the the fluids will evenly split in each direction.

Using Pipe Plugs or painting pipes a different colour can stop pipes connecting.

For each pulse of  power it recieves, it will extract from the adjacent tank.
The more power a pulse has, the more fluids will be extracted per pulse.

The Wooden Diamond Fluid pipe transports fluids to adjacent pipes and tanks at 1.6 buckets per second.
Fluid pipes have an internal fluid tank which can hold 1 bucket per side and 1 Bucket in the centre.
