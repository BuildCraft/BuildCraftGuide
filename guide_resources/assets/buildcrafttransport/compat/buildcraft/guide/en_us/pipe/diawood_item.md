A Wooden Diamond Transport Pipe is used to extract selected items determined by its filter from an inventory when given power.
It can recieve power from any MJ power source such as: an engine, a power adaptor, or a pipe pulsar.

It will extract the items selected in the filter and transport them to any adjacent inventory or connecting pipe.
The extraction of items will occur out of solid side of the pipe and transport them towards the clear facing side.

Opening up the Wooden Diamond Transport Pipe GUI will allow you to setup a filter.
Placing items you want in the slots will allow you to filter what it extracts.
You can use the Whitelist, Blacklist or Round Robin options to change what your filter does:
Whitelist: Only the items selected will be extracted.
Blacklist: Any items other than the items selected will be extracted.
Round robin: Extracts the items in the exact order selected in the above filter slots (from left to right)

A List can be used in a filtering slots to give you expanded filtering options.

Incase out of the pipe outputing to multiple clear facing sides, the items move in a random direction (It is recommended to use pipe plugs to stop the multiple connections).
If there is no connecting pipe or the adjacent inventory is full and there is no where else for the item to go, the item will drop out of the pipe onto the ground.
Some machines can automatically output items directly into a Wooden Diamond Transport Pipe without needing to be fed through an extraction pipe (This will not respect the filters)

For each pulse of power it recieves, it will extract from the adjacent inventory.
The more power a pulse has, the more items will be extracted per pulse.
