A Diazuli Transport Pipe is used to transport sendt painted items it recieves in one direction towards a connecting pipe/inventory.

Items will travel in through the solid sides and be fed out towards the clear facing side.
The direction the painted items will travel can be changed by: Whacking the side of the pipe you want the items to go to with a wrench or with a gate.
You can change which coloured the items are set to travel that direction by whacking the centre of the pipe with a wrench or with a gate.

Items will not travel back in the direction it came from and only in a different direction.
If there is no where for the travelling items to go, they will be dropped out of the pipe onto the ground.

Some machines can automatically output items directly into it without being fed through a powered extraction pipe.
Using Pipe Plugs or painting pipes a different colour can stop pipes connecting.
