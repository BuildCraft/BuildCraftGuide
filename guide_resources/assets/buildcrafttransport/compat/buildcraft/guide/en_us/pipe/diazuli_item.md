A Diazuli Transport Pipe is used to transport set painted items from a pipe in one direction towards either an another adjacent pipe or inventory.

The direction that the items will travel is in through the solid side of the pipe and out towards the clear facing side.
You can change the direction the set painted items will travel to by whacking the side of the Diazuli Transport Pipe you want the items to go to with a wrench or with a gate.
You can change which coloured the items are set to travel that direction by whacking the centre of the Diazuli Transport Pipe with a wrench or with a gate.

Items will not travel back in the direction it came from and only in a different direction.
If there is no other connecting pipe or the adjacent inventory is full and there is no where else for the item to go, the items will drop out of the pipe onto the ground.

Some machines can automatically output items directly into a Diazuli Transport Pipe without needing to be fed through an extraction pipe.
