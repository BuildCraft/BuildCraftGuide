A Emzuli Transport Pipe is gate controlled pipe used to extract selected items determined by its filter from an inventory when given power.
It can recieve power from any MJ power source such as: an engine, a power adaptor, or a pipe pulsar.

When powered, It will extract the items selected in the filter and transport them to any other connected inventories/pipes.
The extraction of items will occur out of solid side of the pipe and transport them towards the clear facing sides.

Opening up the Emzuli Transport Pipe GUI will four colours for four seperate filtering options.
Placing items in the slots will allow you to what each filter extracts.
The colours of the paintbrushes next to the slots will determine what colour they will be painted when extracted can can be changed by clicking on them.
To select which of the four filters is extracted, It requires a gate placed on it with a coloured Extraction Preset action provided. I.e. Redstone signal - > Red Extraction Preset.

A List can be used in a filtering slots to give you expanded filtering options.

If it has multiple clear facing sides, the items move in a random direction.
If there is no where for the item to go, the extracted items will drop out of the pipe onto the ground.

For each pulse of power it recieves, it will extract items from the adjacent inventory.
The more power a pulse has, the more items will be extracted per pulse.

Some machines can automatically output items directly into a Emzuli Pipe without the pipe needing to be powered (This will not respect the filters).
Using Pipe Plugs or painting pipes a different colour can stop pipes connecting.
