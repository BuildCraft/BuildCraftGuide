Gold Fluid pipes are the quickest pipe at transport fluids.

Fluids will not travel back in the direction it came from and only in a different direction.
If there are multiple directions the fluids could go, the fluids will be distrubuted evenly between them.

Some machines can output fluids directly into it without being fed through a powered extraction pipe.
Using Pipe Plugs or painting pipes a different colour can stop pipes connecting.

The Gold Fluid pipe transports fluids to adjacent pipes and tanks at 1.6 buckets per second.
Fluid pipes have an internal fluid tank which can hold 1 bucket per side and 1 Bucket in the centre.
