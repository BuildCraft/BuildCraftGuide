A Iron Fluid Pipe is used to transport fluids from a pipe in one direction towards either an another adjacent pipe or tank.

Some machines can autoput fluids directly into a Iron Fluid Pipe without needing to be fed through an extraction pipe.

The direction that the fluids will travel is in through the solid side of the pipe and out towards the clear facing side.
You can change the direction the fluids will travel to by whacking the side of the Iron Fluid Pipe you want the items to go to with a wrench, giving it a redstone signal or with a gate.

Incase out of the pipe/tank connected to the outputing clear sides is full, the fluids will not bounce back to its previous pipe.

The Iron Fluid pipe transports fluids to adjacent pipes and tanks at 0.8 buckets per second.
Fluid pipes have an internal fluid tank which can hold 1 bucket per side and 1 Bucket in the centre.
