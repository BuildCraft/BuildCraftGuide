Setting the direction the fluids will travel is by either: whacking the side of the pipe you want the items to go to with a wrench, giving it a redstone signal or with a gate.

The direction that the fluids will travel is in through the solid sides of the pipe and out towards the clear facing side.
Fluids will not travel back in the direction it came from and only in the one direction set.

Using Pipe Plugs or painting pipes a different colour can stop pipes connecting.

The Iron Fluid pipe transports fluids to adjacent pipes and tanks at 0.8 buckets per second.
Fluid pipes have an internal fluid tank which can hold 1 bucket per side and 1 Bucket in the centre.
