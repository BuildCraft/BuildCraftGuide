A Lazuli Transport Pipe is used to paint items and transport them from a pipe into either another adjacent pipe or inventory.

The Lazuli Transport pipe will paint an item that transfers through it the colour set which can give you extra filtering options.
You can change which colour the Lazuli Pipe will paint the items by whacking the Lazuli Transport Pipe with a wrench or with a Gate.

Incase of their being multiple directions items could go, the items will go in a random direction.(It is recommended to use pipe plugs to stop the multiple connections).
Items will not travel back in the direction it came from and only in a different direction.
If there is no connecting pipe or the adjacent inventory is full and there is no where else for the item to go, the item will drop out of the pipe onto the ground.

Some machines can automatically output items directly into a Lazuli Transport Pipe without needing to be fed through an extraction pipe.
