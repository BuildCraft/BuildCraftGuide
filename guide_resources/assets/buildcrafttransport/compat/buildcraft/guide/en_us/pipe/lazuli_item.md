A Lazuli Transport Pipe is used to paint items and transport them to connected pipes/inventories.

It will paint an item that travels through it to the colour set.
The colour it will paint the items can be changed by being whacked with a wrench or through a Gate.

If it has multiple clear facing sides, the items will move in a random direction.
Items will not travel back in the direction it came from and only go a different direction.
If there is no where for the travelling items to go, they will be dropped out of the pipe onto the ground.

Some machines can automatically output items directly into it without being fed through a powered extraction pipe.
Using Pipe Plugs or painting pipes a different colour can stop pipes connecting.
