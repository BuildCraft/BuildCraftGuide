A Obsidian Transport Pipe is used to pick up in world items and transport them into either another adjacent pipe or inventory.
It can recieve power from any MJ power source such as: an engine, a power adaptor, or a pipe pulsar.

When powered, It can pick up items in a 3x4x3 area above it.
Without power it will still pick up any items which come into contact with the pipe.

For each pulse of power it recieves, it will pick up items from the ground.
The more power a pulse has, the more items will pick up per pulse.

An Obsidian Transport Pipe has to be 'pointing' in a direction to have an area of effect.
With multiple pipes or inventories connected to an Obsidian Transport Pipe, It will lose its ability to pick up items from the world.
If there is no connecting pipe or the adjacent inventory is full and there is no where else for the item to go, the item will drop back out of the pipe onto the ground.

Some machines can automatically output items directly into a Obsidian Transport Pipe without needing to be fed through an extraction pipe.
