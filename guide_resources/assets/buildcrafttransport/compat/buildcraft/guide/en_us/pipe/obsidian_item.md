<chapter name="Pipe Operation"/>
When powered, It can pick up items in a 3x4x3 area above it.
Without power it will still pick up any items which come into contact with the pipe.

<chapter name="Pipe Direction"/>
An Obsidian Transport Pipe has to be 'pointing' in a direction to have an area of effect.
If the pipe has multiple connections, It will lose its ability to pick up items from the world.

<chapter name="Pipe Mechanics"/>
If there is no where for the recieved items to go, they will be dropped out of the pipe onto the ground.
Using Pipe Plugs or painting pipes a different colour can stop pipes connecting.

<chapter name="Powering"/>
It can recieve power from any MJ power source such as: an engine, a power adaptor, or a pipe pulsar.

For each pulse of power it recieves, it will pick up items from the ground.
The more power a pulse has, the more items will pick up per pulse.
