A Obsidian Transport Pipe is used to pick up in world items and transport them into a connecting pipe/inventory.
It can recieve power from any MJ power source such as: an engine, a power adaptor, or a pipe pulsar.

When powered, It can pick up items in a 3x4x3 area above it.
Without power it will still pick up any items which come into contact with the pipe.

For each pulse of power it recieves, it will pick up items from the ground.
The more power a pulse has, the more items will pick up per pulse.

An Obsidian Transport Pipe has to be 'pointing' in a direction to have an area of effect.
If the pipe has multiple connections, It will lose its ability to pick up items from the world.
If there is no where for the recieved items to go, they will be dropped out of the pipe onto the ground.

Using Pipe Plugs or painting pipes a different colour can stop pipes connecting.
