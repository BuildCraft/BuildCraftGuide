A Quartz Transport Pipe is used to transport items from a pipe into either another adjacent pipe or inventory.

The Quartz Transport pipe gives transported items a small amount of drag so they will slow accelerated items.

Quartz Transport pipes will not connect to Cobblestone Transport Pipes or Stone Transport Pipes.

Incase of their being multiple directions items could go, the items will go in a random direction.(It is recommended to use pipe plugs to stop the multiple connections).
Items will not travel back in the direction it came from and only in a different direction.
If there is no connecting pipe or the adjacent inventory is full and there is no where else for the item to go, the item will drop out of the pipe onto the ground.

Some machines can automatically output items directly into a Quartz Transport Pipe without needing to be fed through an extraction pipe.
