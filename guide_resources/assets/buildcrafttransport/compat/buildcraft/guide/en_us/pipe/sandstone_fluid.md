It does not connect to any machine so it only connects to other pipes.

Fluids will not travel back in the direction it came from and only in a different direction.
If there are multiple directions the fluids could go, the fluids will be distributed evenly between them.

Using Pipe Plugs or painting pipes a different colour can stop pipes connecting.

The Sandstone Fluid pipe transports fluids to adjacent pipes and tanks at 0.4 buckets per second.
Fluid pipes have an internal fluid tank which can hold 1 bucket per side and 1 Bucket in the centre.
