A Sandstone Fluid Pipe is used to transport fluids from a pipe into another adjacent pipe.

It does not connect to any machine so it only connects to other pipes.

Fluids will not travel back in the direction it came from and only in a different direction.
Incase of their being multiple directions fluids could go, the fluids will be distrubuted evenly between them.
(It is recommended to use pipe plugs to stop the multiple connections)

The Sandstone Fluid pipe transports fluids to adjacent pipes at 0.4 buckets per second.
Fluid pipes have an internal fluid tank which can hold 1 bucket per side and 1 Bucket in the centre.
