It does not connect to any machine so it only connects to other pipes.

If it has multiple connecting sides, the items will travel in a random direction.
Items will not travel back in the direction it came from and only go a different direction.
If there is no where for the travelling items to go, they will be dropped out of the pipe onto the ground.

Using Pipe Plugs or painting pipes a different colour can stop pipes connecting.
