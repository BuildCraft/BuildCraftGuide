A Sandstone Transport Pipe is used to transport items from a pipe into another adjacent pipe.

It does not connect to any machine so it only connects to other pipes.

Incase of their being multiple directions items could go, the items will go in a random direction.(It is recommended to use pipe plugs to stop the multiple connections).
Items will not travel back in the direction it came from and only in a different direction.
If there is no connecting pipe and there is no where else for the item to go, the item will drop out of the pipe onto the ground.
