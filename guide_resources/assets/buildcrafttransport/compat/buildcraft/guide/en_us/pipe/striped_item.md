A Striped Transport Pipe is used to break blocks, place blocks use items fed through it and transport them into either another adjacent pipe or inventory.
It can recieve power from any MJ power source such as: an engine, a power adaptor, or a pipe pulsar.

When powered, It will break the block directly infront of it and pass it on to the adjacent pipe or inventory.
When a block is fed through it, It will place the block directly infront of it.
When an item is fed through it, It will attempt to 'use' it on the block/entity infront of it.

For each pulse of power it recieves, it will use the power it recieved and attempt to break the block infront of it.
The more power a pulse has, the more power will be used to break the block.

An Striped Transport Pipe has to be 'pointing' in a direction to effect the block infront of it.
With multiple pipes or inventories connected to an Striped Transport Pipe, It will lose its ability affect from the world.
If there is no connecting pipe or the adjacent inventory is full and there is no where else for the item to go, the item will drop back out of the pipe onto the ground.

Some machines can automatically output items directly into a Striped Transport Pipe without needing to be fed through an extraction pipe.
