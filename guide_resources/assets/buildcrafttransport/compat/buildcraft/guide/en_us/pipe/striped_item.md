A Striped Transport Pipe is used to break blocks, place blocks use items fed through it and transport them into a connecting pipe/inventory.
It can recieve power from any MJ power source such as: an engine, a power adaptor, or a pipe pulsar.

When powered, It will break the block directly infront of it and pass it on to the adjacent pipe or inventory.
When a block is fed through it, It will place the block directly infront of it.
When an item is fed through it, It will attempt to 'use' it on the block/entity infront of it.

For each pulse of power it recieves, it will use the power it recieved and attempt to break the block infront of it.
The more power a pulse has, the more power will be used to break the block.

An Striped Transport Pipe has to be 'pointing' in a direction to effect the block infront of it.
With multiple pipes/inventories connected to it, It will lose its ability affect from the world.
If there is no where for the travelling items to go, they will be dropped out of the pipe onto the ground.

Some machines can automatically output items directly into it without being fed through a powered extraction pipe.
Using Pipe Plugs or painting pipes a different colour can stop pipes connecting.
