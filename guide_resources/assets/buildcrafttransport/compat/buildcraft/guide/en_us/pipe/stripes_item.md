<chapter name="Pipe Operation"/>
When powered, It will break the block directly infront of it and pass it on to the adjacent pipe or inventory.
When a block is fed through it, It will place the block directly infront of it.
When an item is fed through it, It will attempt to 'use' it on the block/entity infront of it.

<chapter name="Pipe Direction"/>
An Striped Transport Pipe has to be 'pointing' in a direction to effect the block infront of it.
With multiple pipes/inventories connected to it, It will lose its ability affect from the world.

<chapter name="Pipe Mechanics"/>
If there is no where for the travelling items to go, they will be dropped out of the pipe onto the ground.
Using Pipe Plugs or painting pipes a different colour can stop pipes connecting.

<chapter name="Powering"/>
It can recieve power from any MJ power source such as: an engine, a power adaptor, or a pipe pulsar.

<link to="buildcraftsilicon:item/plug_pulsar"/> 
For each pulse of power it recieves, it will use the power it recieved and attempt to break the block infront of it.
The more power a pulse has, the more power will be used to break the block.
