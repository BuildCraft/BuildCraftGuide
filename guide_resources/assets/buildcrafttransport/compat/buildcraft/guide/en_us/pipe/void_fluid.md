A Void Fluid Pipe is used to destroy fluids that are fed into it.

Fluids can not travel through the pipe as any fluids that reach the centre are automatically destroyed.

Some machines can autoput fluids directly into a Void Fluid Pipe without needing to be fed through an extraction pipe.

Fluid pipes have an internal fluid tank which can hold 1 bucket per side and 1 Bucket in the centre.
