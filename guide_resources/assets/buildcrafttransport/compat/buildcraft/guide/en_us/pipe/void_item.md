A Void Transport Pipe is used to destroy items that are fed into it.

Items can not travel through the pipe as any items that reach the centre are automatically destroyed.

Some machines can automatically output items directly into it without being fed through a powered extraction pipe.
Using Pipe Plugs or painting pipes a different colour can stop pipes connecting.
