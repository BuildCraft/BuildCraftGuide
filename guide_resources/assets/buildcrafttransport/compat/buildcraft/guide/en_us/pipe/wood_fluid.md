When powered, It will extracted fluid and transport the fluid into any other connecting tanks/pipes.
Some machines can autoput fluids directly into a Wooden Fluid Pipe without needing power.
The extraction of fluids will occur out of solid side of the pipe towards the clear facing sides.
If it has multiple clear facing sides, the the fluids will evenly split in each direction.

Some machines can autoput fluids directly into a Wooden Fluid Pipe without needing power.
Using Pipe Plugs or painting pipes a different colour can stop pipes connecting.

<chapter name="Powering"/>
It can recieve power from any MJ power source such as: an engine, a power adaptor, or a pipe pulsar.

For each pulse of  power it recieves, it will extract fluid from the adjacent tank.
The more power a pulse has, the more fluids will be extracted per pulse.

The Wooden Fluid pipe transports fluids to adjacent pipes and tanks at 0.2 buckets per second.
Fluid pipes have an internal fluid tank which can hold 1 bucket per side and 1 Bucket in the centre.
