A Wooden Fluid Pipe is used to extract fluids from an tank when given power.
It can recieve power from any MJ power source such as: an engine, a power adaptor, or a pipe pulsar.

It will put the extracted fluids into any other adjacent tank or connecting pipe.
Some machines can autoput fluids directly into a Wooden Fluid Pipe without needing power.

The extraction of fluids will occur out of solid side of the pipe towards the clear facing side.
Incase out of the pipe outputing to multiple clear facing sides, the direction the fluids will evenly split.
(It is recommended to use pipe plugs to stop the multiple connections)

For each pulse of  power it recieves, it will extract from the adjacent tank.
The more power a pulse has, the more fluids will be extracted per pulse.

The Wooden Fluid pipe transports fluids to adjacent pipes and tanks at 0.2 buckets per second.
Fluid pipes have an internal fluid tank which can hold 1 bucket per side and 1 Bucket in the centre.
