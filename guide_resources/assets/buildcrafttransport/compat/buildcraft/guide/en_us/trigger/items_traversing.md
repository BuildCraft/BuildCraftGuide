Items Traversing is a gate trigger provided on any gate that is placed on a transport pipe.

When selected, the connected actions will only be activated when an item is travelling through the pipe.

When Items Traversing and the gate installed has parameters available, the Filter slot next to it becomes available as a parameter.
Placing an item in the filter slots allows you check if the item selected in the filter slot is traveling through the pipe before triggering.
